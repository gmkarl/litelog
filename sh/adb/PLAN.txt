PLAN:
[ ] don't forget to add beepme data
[x] just store the sqlite3 file in tmp for now.  it'll get synced as a priority file for conversion
[x] copy from fetch.sh a basic function to relatively-correctly take a file from a connected phone and archive it
[ ] non-sqlite3 files can be finalized
  [ ] beepme
  [x] voice recorder
  [x] muse
  [x] call recorder
