[x] make systemd script to run record <== do one of these first
[ ] make init.d script to run record
[x] make record script
[ ] make a way to disable generation of raw logfiles <== then one of these two
[ ] make free space script to remove raw logs
[ ] make compression script to condense csv files, at least to .gz, preferably something smaller
    note the logfiles can also be flac'd and xmp'd, I already made code to do this elsewhere.  could then opus the flac files ...
