sh/git-annex
============

Manages LOGDIR as a git-annex repository.

git-annex is an extension to git for managing very large files and automatically syncing with
remotes so as to ensure, for example, a provided number of backups is always maintained.
It provides for a single checksum to verify the integrity of your entire logging history without
requiring you to have all of the historical files actually present.
